# Phoomparin's Dotfiles!

This is my dotfiles, which includes everything I use on my macbook. It installs macOS apps and CLI tools via Homebrew, contains my configuration for CLI apps (e.g. Fish, Tmux, Neovim), and bootstraps the entire machine from scratch!

## Installation

Just clone the repo, and run the `./install` shell script! That's it.

```
# Clone and cd into the dotfiles repo
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/phoomparin/dotfiles
cd dotfiles

# One-line install!
./install
```
