# Project Specific Preferences

- @~/Workspaces/metabase/metabase/.claude-private/CLAUDE.md
  - Stores the CLAUDE.md local memory for the "metabase" repository

## Test Preferences

- Do not run the Cypress tests for me. I will run the tests myself.
- Never ever remove it.only from tests unless I tell you explicitly to do so.

## Linting Preferences

- For metabase repo, do not run `yarn lint-eslint` as it is not designed to be ran for individual files.
